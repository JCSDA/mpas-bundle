#--- Building the mpas-jedi bundle ---
#    Assume you have the spack-stack-1.3.1 build environment installed in your computer.
#    https://github.com/JCSDA/spack-stack (clone and then checkout the release/1.3.1 branch)

#    cd /somewhere/to/store; mkdir mpas-bundle-2.0.0; cd mpas-bundle-2.0.0
#    git clone -b release/2.0.0 https://github.com/JCSDA/mpas-bundle.git code
#    mkdir build; cd build
#
#    # loading spack-stack-1.3.1 build environment, If building on Cheyenne under csh
#    source ../code/env-setup/gnu-openmpi-cheyenne.csh
#
#    ecbuild ../code
#    make -j4

The ecbuild command above will clone all the source code for the projects defined in the
CMakeLists.txt in the bundle and the make command will build them all.

The CMakeLists.txt file under ~code/ contains the list of the repositories included
in the bundle and the TAGs (code version in June 2023) to be used.

To run the mpas-jedi ctests (from build directory):

    cd mpas-jedi
    ctest -N (only list names of ctest cases, not execute them)
    ctest

--- Note about using git ---

It is recommended that you create a .gitconfig file in your home directory (inside the container
if working from a container) with the following content:

$ cat .gitconfig 
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = yourname@somewhere.something

[credential]
    helper = cache --timeout=3600


Since the bundle acceses many repositories, it can be tedious to enter your username and
password for every operation. With the last line the system will remember your password for
a given time (defined in seconds by the timeout parameter).
