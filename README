#--- Building the mpas-jedi bundle ---
#
#    cd /somewhere/to/store/source/code
#    git clone https://github.com/JCSDA-internal/mpas-bundle.git
#
#    # (If building on Cheyenne)
#    source mpas-bundle/env-setup/<desired compiler-mpi script>
#
#    cd /somewhere/to/build
#    ecbuild /somewhere/to/store/source/code/mpas-bundle
#    make -j4

The ecbuild command above will clone all the source code for the projects defined in the
CMakeLists.txt in the bundle and the make command will build them all.

The default build-type is 'release'. For a debug build, add '--build=debug' to the ecbuild
command line.

To work with a different branch than the default for a given project, the branch must be
modified in the CMakeLists.txt for the bundle.

Note: ecbuild accepts all cmake flags, for example, compilers can be selected with:
    ecbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/gcc-7.2/bin/g++ ${SRC}

To run the mpas-jedi ctests (from build directory):

    cd mpasjedi
    ctest


--- Working with the code ---

The CMakeLists.txt file in this directory contains the list of the repositories included
in the bundle and the branch to be used. The branch specified in the CMakeLists.txt is
the one that will be compiled. When working with you own branch, the should be changed in
the CMakeLists.txt file but it is not necessary to re-run ecbuild, make is enough.

After the first build, changes in the code can be tested by re-running only
(from build directory):

    make -j4
    cd mpasjedi
    ctest

By default, make will not update your local repository from the remote. To update all repositories
in the bundle, run (from build directory):

    make update

The update will fail for repositories that contain uncommited code. This is a safety mechanism to
avoid losing your work.

--- Note about using git ---

It is recommended that you create a .gitconfig file in your home directory (inside the container
if working from a container) with the following content:

$ cat .gitconfig 
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = yourname@somewhere.something

[credential]
    helper = cache --timeout=3600


Since the bundle acceses many repositories, it can be tedious to enter your username and
password for every operation. With the last line the system will remember your password for
a given time (defined in seconds by the timeout parameter).
